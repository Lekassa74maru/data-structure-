# data-structure
# Description
## This C++ program implements  
1. Singly Linked List  
2. Doubly Linked List
3.  Circular Singly Linked List 
4. Circular Doubly Linked List
#### to manage student information and employee. Each student and employee has the following attributes:
- **ID**: A uniquely identifier for each student and employees.
- **Name**: The name of the student and name employee.
- **Age**: The age of the student and age of employee.
### The program allows various operations, such as
* insertion,
* deletion,
* searching,
* and displaying student and employee details.
  ## Features
#### The program supports the following operations:
1.	***Insert at the Beginning***Add a new student and employee node to the start of the list.
2.	***Insert at the End***Add a new student and employee node to the end of the list.
3.	***Insert by Searching***: Insert a new student and employee node after a specific ID.
4.	***Delete at the Beginning***Remove the first student and employee node from the list.
5.	***Delete at the End***: Remove the last student and employee node from the list.
6.	***Delete by Searching***: Remove a student and employee node by searching for its ID.
7.	***Search by ID***: Search for a student and employee using their unique ID and display their information.
8.	***Display***: Display all student and employee nodes in the list.
9.	***exit***
  ## How It Works
The program uses a Student class and employee structure to represent each node and a Student and employee information class to manage the linked list operations. Each node contains:
+ Stores the student and employee ID.
+ Stores the student and employee name.
+ Stores the student and employee age.
+ Points to the next student and employee node in the list next pointer.
+ Point to the previous student and employee node in the list 
#### Circular Behaviour for who have that properties 
The next pointer of the last node links back to the head node, creating a circular structure.     
## How to Run
#### 1.	***Requirements:***
- C++ compiler (e.g.devc++).
#### 2.	***Steps:***
- Copy the code into a .cpp file/download 
- Compile the program using your C++ compiler:

## Menu Options
When you run the program, you will see the following menu:
1. Insert at beginning: add new student and employee node to the start of the list.
2. Insert at beginning: add new student and employee node to the end of the list.
3. Insert by search id: insert new student and employee node after specific id.
4. Delete at beginning: remove the first student and employee node.
5. Delete at end: remove the list student and employee
6. Delete at end: remove the last student and employee node.
7. Search by id: search for student and employee using there id and display their information.
8. Display: display all student and employee list.
9. ***Exit***: exit the program.

 ## Example Usage
1. ***Insert Nodes:***
Select option 1 or 2 to insert a data at the beginning or end of the list.
2. ***Insert After a Specific ID:***
Select option 3, then enter the ID of an existing data. Add details for the new data to insert.
3. ***Delete Nodes:***
Use options 4, 5, or 6 to delete nodes at the beginning, end, or by ID.
4.	***Search for a Node:***
Use option 7, enter the student or employee ID, and view their information.
5.	***Display All Nodes:***
Select option 8 to display the list of all information.
# Limitations
The program assumes the user will enter valid inputs it not work properly.
The program does not handle duplicate id.
League dependant since it is written by c++
